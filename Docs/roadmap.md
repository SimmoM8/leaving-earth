# üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core Gameplay Prototype ‚Äì Earth Launch

- [ ] Rocket part system (modular components, voxel-style prefabs)
- [ ] Basic rocket builder UI (drag/drop + dropdown options)
- [ ] Earth base scene with store/trade interface
- [ ] Currency and purchasing logic
- [ ] Launchpad and flight scene
- [ ] Realistic physics simulation (gravity, thrust, drag)
- [ ] Launch failure handling (crash, explosion, etc.)
- [ ] Simple reward loop (data/XP from launches)

## Phase 2: Exploration Loop & Upgrade System

- [ ] Procedural galaxy generation with seeded systems
- [ ] Fixed Solar System (Earth, Moon, Mars, etc.)
- [ ] In-space navigation and exploration (third-person)
- [ ] Modular ship upgrades (engine, shield, scanner, fuel tank, etc.)
- [ ] Research/data collection system
- [ ] Tech tree progression (unlocks via data)
- [ ] Resource scanning and basic harvesting
- [ ] Persistent ship state and inventory

## Phase 3: Advanced World Simulation

- [ ] Station/base interactions (trading, building, missions)
- [ ] Combat encounters (optional AI/ship threats)
- [ ] Procedural event system (anomalies, alien signals)
- [ ] Galaxy map and navigation interface
- [ ] Story progression with fixed and dynamic triggers

## Long-Term Goals

- [ ] Launch-ready build for mobile/PC
- [ ] Monetization model (premium or freemium)
- [ ] Polish and UX tuning
- [ ] Steam or app store deployment
