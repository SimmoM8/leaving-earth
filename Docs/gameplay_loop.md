## Core Gameplay Loop

1. **PLAN**
   - Decide goal (e.g. reach upper atmosphere, orbit Earth, land on the Moon)
   - Review current inventory, tech level, and budget

2. **BUY / GATHER**
   - Use currency to buy parts, tools, or gather materials via mining or trade
   - Invest in research/data analysis for tech unlocks (e.g. heat shields, guidance systems)

3. **BUILD**
   - Use simplified drag-and-drop or snap-to-grid rocket assembly interface
   - Assemble components logically (engine, tank, capsule, parachute, etc.)
   - Attach modules with structural constraints (weight, thrust, balance)

4. **LAUNCH**
   - Enter launch sequence: countdown → ignition
   - Use Newtonian & relativistic physics during flight
   - Manage fuel, trajectory, heat, G-force, atmospheric drag

5. **RESULT**
   - SUCCESS: Gain data from mission, progress tech, unlock new parts, gain funding
   - FAILURE: Crash, explode, fall — recover scrap/materials/data, adjust plan

6. **REPEAT**
   - With better parts, more currency, and new tech, attempt further goals (orbit, docking, leaving Earth)
