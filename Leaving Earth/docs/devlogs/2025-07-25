## What I Did Today

- Defined core game idea, genre, and loop
- Wrote initial design docs:
  - core_idea
  - gameplay_loop
  - mechanics
  - world_and_story
- Planned folder structure for Git + VS Code

## Notes

- Game should balance peace and tension
- MVP will focus on movement, upgrades, and exploration
- Tech unlocks will be driven by discovery, not XP

## Next Steps

- Choose engine: Unity or Godot
- Set up `/src/` with basic movement prototype
- Start coding first upgradeable module
